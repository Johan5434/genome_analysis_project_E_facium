Hi, 

Inside this directory you will find two pytnon scripts that I used to trim and categorize the public sequencing data for e_facium

The program will run with the command "make", and resulting files will be cleaned with the command: "make clean". 

However, I've moved the dependencies and also the resulting files to /data/metadata_public , 
thus, these scripts are no longer in use.
